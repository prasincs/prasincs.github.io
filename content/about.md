## Open Source Projects

I'm passionate about contributing to open source. Here are some projects I've worked on:

A lightweight container runtime and orchestration framework.

### [go-tenable](https://github.com/mistsys/go-tenable)
Go client library for the Tenable API, making it easier to interact with Tenable security products programmatically.

### [Accord](https://github.com/mistsys/accord)
A distributed consensus library and framework.

### Apache Kafka - Zookeeper Maintainer
I was briefly a maintainer for the Zookeeper components of Apache Kafka, contributing to the reliability and stability of one of the most widely-used distributed streaming platforms. You can find my contributions in the [Apache Kafka JIRA](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KAFKA).

## Current Interests

I'm particularly interested in:
